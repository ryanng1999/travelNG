      <br>
      <p>Since June 5, 2024, the congestion pricing program has been indefinitely postponed, putting $15 billion in MTA transit improvements in jeopardy. Projects such as extending the Second Avenue Subway and modernizing subway signals are on hold. Without congestion pricing revenue, the MTA is unable to issue new bonds for these critical projects. Alternative funding options, such as a new payroll tax increase on the City's businesses, are being considered. Transit leaders have expressed concern about the lack of a backup plan for funding transit investments. The MTA Board, controlled by the governor, is facing questions about their fiduciary duty in light of this decision.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Almost a month later, New York State lawmakers started considering reducing the $15 base fee for congestion pricing with discussions on finding a price that is low enough for acceptance but high enough to fund MTA projects. Hopefully, the program will become thawed. The changes would require legislative amendments and approval from the MTA Board and Federal Highway Administration, which could delay the process. The fate of congestion pricing may ultimately be influenced by who wins the 2024 United States presidential election. Elected officials and experts do not know what price would effectively reduce gridlock in Manhattan's Central Business District, with concerns over the impact on drivers and transit funding.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Calls for alternative measures to generate funds for transit improvements in New York City should include decreasing local bus fares and increasing Manhattan tunnel tolls to increase public transit ridership and funding for the MTA. Installing security cameras at each subway turnstile is also recommended to combat fare evasion, which cost the MTA an estimated $690 million in 2022. Proposals to offer a discount to all CUNY and SUNY students onboard the subway and local buses aim to encourage more students to use public transit and support environmental conservation efforts.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To increase MTA commuter railroad ridership, the MTA has to start charging intermediate fares instead of peak and off-peak fares. CityTicket should provide New Yorkers the same benefits offered in the Long Island Rail Road's former Atlantic Ticket program. Each MTA commuter railroad fare should have at least one local transit transfer. By implementing these changes, the number of people riding the MTA commuter railroads would increase significantly, saving both time and money for riders.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As the MTA grapples with the uncertainty surrounding the Central Business District Tolling Program, stakeholders are seeking creative solutions to ensure the future of public transit in New York City. Overall, the goal is to increase ridership onboard trains and buses and give the MTA more funds to improve.</p>
